It assigns specific functions to both levels of government that are relevant to spatial planning.\n\n-   \n\nArticle 186: County Governments: Article 186 establishes county governments and assigns them various functions, including urban and rural planning. While the term \"spatial planning\" is not explicitly used, urban and rural planning encompass the spatial aspects of development within counties.\n\n\n\n-   Article 187: County Planning and Development: Article 187 outlines the functions of county governments in planning and development. It includes functions such as land-use planning, zoning, and establishment of urban areas, which are integral to spatial planning.\n\n-   Fourth Schedule: Distribution of Functions between National and County Governments: The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution delineates the functions of both the national government and county governments. It includes several functions related to physical planning and land use, which imply a shared responsibility for spatial planning.\n\n-   Article 189: Relationship between National and County Governments: Article 189 establishes the principle of cooperation and consultation between the national government and county governments in the exercise of their functions. This provision emphasizes the need for collaboration in matters of spatial planning to ensure coherence and consistency in development planning and implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](system.png){width=517}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Constitutional Provisions\n\n-   Formulation of general principles of land planning and coordination of planning by the counties to ensure uniformity and quality in delivery of planning services in all parts of the country.\n\n-   Capacity building and technical assistance to counties to ensure adequate and appropriate skills and competences for delivery of physical planning services.\n\n-   Formulation of National Spatial Plan and Land Use Policy for optimal use of land and natural resources.\n\n-   Formulation of broad Physical Planning policies, standards and guidelines.\n\n-   Preparation of Regional plans.Undertaking research on physical planning mattersAdvising the NLC on land reservation, alienation and acquisition for national projects.\n\n## County Level Functions\n\n1.
